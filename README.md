# Minimal-Portfolio-Design :wave:

> **Complete Responsive Web Design | Minimal Portfolio Website | HTML, CSS & JS (JQUERY+ GSAP)**

### Tools.

[1]. Bootstrap 4 (Responsive Layout)<br>
[2]. WOW.js ( + Animate.css to create scroll reveal animations)<br>
[3]. TweenMax (To reveal navigation)<br>
[4]. Ionicons<br>
[5]. Google Fonts (Roboto Mono)


### Idea

> **The current philosophy of UI design is “less is more,” 
the expected rise in popularity of minimalism has reached an all-time high and I have tried one more time to touch this concept as usual.**

> **I preferred **Bootstrap** just to create responsive columns so we can concentrate more on other parts of website.**
